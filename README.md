# Home-Browser
A very simple browser to connect to Arduino and esp8266 based projects.

What is the Home Browser?

This is a project I built because I was having strange errors when using my Android phone to access projects I made that are WiFi connected.
Since the browser has absolutely no security built in and is very primitive, it is restricted to browsing pages on the home network. Any page that is outside of the 192.168.0.0-192.168.255.255 range is locked out.

The project is entirely written using the MIT App Inventor 2. It is free to use and very easy to understand. It can be accessed at the following address http://ai2.appinventor.mit.edu/
